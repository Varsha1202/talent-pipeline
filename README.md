# Talent_Pipleline

# Project Overview

Talent Pipeline is a two-sided hiring platform designed to reduce the communication gap between recruiters and candidates. Unlike standard ATS tools, it emphasizes transparency and efficiency:
1. Candidates can track their application status in real time.
2. Recruiters manage applicants via a kanban-style pipeline for intuitive workflow management.
3. Structured candidate profiles, quick feedback templates, and a simplified scheduling flow enhance productivity.
This project demonstrates full-stack development skills as well as product sense, combining backend functionality, frontend interactivity, and a thoughtful user experience.
